        An Azure Availability Set is a logical grouping of virtual machines (VMs) in Azure. When you create VMs within an Availability Set, the Azure platform distributes the placement of those VMs across the underlying infrastructure. During planned maintenance on the Azure platform, or in the event of an unexpected fault in the underlying hardware/infrastructure, Availability Sets ensure that at least one VM remains operational.
